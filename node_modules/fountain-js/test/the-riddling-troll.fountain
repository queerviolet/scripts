EXT. BRIDGE – DAY

A STONE BRIDGE stands over a wide rushing river. In the distance a castle is sitting amidst rolling green hills. This is the kingdom of IMBUR.

BENEVOL (32), captain of the guards of Imbur, rides up to the bridge where he is stopped by BARDUS, a troll.

      BARDUS
  Hello there!

      BENEVOL
  Good Day, Troll. I am Sir Benevol and I’m on my way to the Kingdom of Imbur. The King is expecting me.

      BARDUS
  Sure. But I cannot let you pass until you solve a riddle.

      BENEVOL
  Indeed. What is it?

      BARDUS
  Listen carefully. On the mountains I am found, from the treetops to the ground. With every step that you draw near, I seem to simply disappear.

BENEVOL ponders on the riddle for a beat.

      BENEVOL
  That is simple.

      BARDUS
  Yes?

      BENEVOL
  It is fog, is it not?

      BARDUS
  You got it! The Kingdom of Imbur awaits you.

BENEVOL continues on his way across the bridge and towards the castle.

INT. CASTLE – DAY

King NARUS is standing in the entrance hall of Imbur Castle. Next to him is a SERVANT. NARUS stares at the giant wooden doors in front of him.

      NARUS
    (excited)
  He should be returning any moment now. I sent him to challenge Queen Regina to a Riddling Contest. 

The SERVANT doesn’t seem to share NARUS’s enthusiasm.

      NARUS 
    (cont’d)
  We would each choose a champion and see who could out-riddle who.

The doors in front of him open to reveal BENEVOL who makes his way towards the king.

      NARUS
  Ah, Benevol.

      BENEVOL
  Queen Regina of Setera accepts your challenge, your highness.

The King smiles.

      BENEVOL
    (cont'd)
  But I must remind you that her champion will most likely be that wizard, Malus. It is said that those of a magic mind are gifted in wit. He will be a tough competitor.

      NARUS
  Thats why I have chosen you as my champion.

BENEVOL is shocked.

      BENEVOL
  But sire, I have little talent at riddling!

      NARUS
  Benevol, you do have riddling talent! Many times have you reentered our kingdom only to face the troll at our entrance. Each time you have solved his riddles. That is proof enough for me that you are worthy to be our champion.

      BENEVOL
  But sire! The troll from the bridge is a far greater riddler than I.

      NARUS
  The troll from the bridge is not someone that I want representing my kingdom. The subject is mute. I will see you here tomorrow for the contest.

BENEVOL hurries out of the castle and mounts his horse.

EXT. BRIDGE – DAY

BARDUS and BENEVOL are at the bridge.

      BENEVOL
  Is the answer... Time?

      BARDUS
  That's another one solved.

A beat.

Thanks for helping me, BARDUS, --

> GLASS RIPPLE TO:


INT. WIZARD LAB – DAY

BARDUS and BENEVOL can be seen inside a crystal ball.

      BENEVOL 
    (cont'd)
  --I'm not sure if I would have had a chance without you.

The crystal ball resides on a desk inside a dark room. The walls are covered in shelves of vials of varying colours. MALUS, the wizarding champion of Setera, is watching BENEVOL and BARDUS through the crystal ball.

      BARDUS
  You can solve riddles easily but you still need to work on thinking of new ones...

MALUS smiles. A SERVANT pokes their head into the room.

      SERVANT
  MALUS, your magical assistance is needed in here.

MALUS hesitates.

      SERVANT 
    (cont'd)
  ...and bring some gloves, it's worse than a Goblin Dung Party in here.

MALUS shudders. He gets up and leaves the room. BENEVOL and BARDUS continue their riddling practice inside the crystal ball.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

A large crowd has gathered around a stage upon which stands Queen REGINA, MALUS, and King NARUS. BENEVOL is nowhere to be found. There are several other KNIGHTS standing at the foot of the stage.

      NARUS
    (to one of the knights)
  Find Benevol! He is probably over with that blasted troll!

      VOICE (O.S.)
  I am here!

A STRANGER dressed as a knight moves towards the stage.

      NARUS
  BENEVOL? Is that you?

      STRANGER
  Indeed it is I!

NARUS moves aside with the stranger.

      NARUS
  Why are you wearing your full suit of armour, Benevol?

      STRANGER
  I believe that it will help me win this contest, if you don't mind sire.

      NARUS
  Your voice appears to be different as well. I do hope that is indeed you in there, Benevol...
  
Regina moves towards the front of the stage.

      REGINA
  Let's get this contest underway!

The stranger makes his way onto the stage as NARUS rejoins the others.

NARUS turns to MALUS and the stranger.

      NARUS
  You both know the rules. You will each take turns to challenge each other with a riddle. If your opponent cannot correctly answer your riddle then you will be claimed the winner. Malus, you will go first.

MALUS makes a menacing smile at the stranger.

      MALUS
  Good. My first riddle is simple. When there's nothing I am there. I am all when there's no air. I am terror. I am fear. I'm never far but never near.

A beat.

There is a sudden clang of metal as the STRANGER raises his hand.

      STRANGER
  The answer is Silence!

      MALUS
  That is correct.

      STRANGER
  It is my turn then. This is my riddle. The heavens and the sea the same, six brothers after rain.

      MALUS
  HA! I have heard this one before. The troll from the bridge asked it of me this very morning. You are supposed to think of your own riddles!

      STRANGER
  I did think of it. Now answer it or do you forfeit?

      MALUS
  Very well, the answer is Blue. Now solve this riddle. When secrets tell of a frozen hell, and time has ceased to flow. Where little lost boys are blind to the years. Where reasons rise from crocodile tears, and darkness begins to glow.

A beat.

      STRANGER
  I have heard this riddle before, MALUS.

      MALUS
    (murmur)
  Yes, I thought you might have.

      STRANGER
  The answer is Never!

MALUS isn't surprised.

A beat.

      MALUS
    (sharply)
  Hurry it up then. What is your next riddle?

      STRANGER
    (slowly)
  Ok... my next riddle is... what is under my helmet?

MALUS roars with laughter.

      MALUS
  You think you have fooled me, do you? I tell you, you have not. I have known from the start that you were not really Benevol! You are the Troll from under the bridge.

The stranger pauses for a beat.

A stunned silence sweeps over the crowd as the knight slowly reaches up to remove his helmet. There is a collective 'gasp' as BENEVOL's head emerges from underneath.

      BENEVOL
  I'm afraid that you're incorrect, Malus.

MALUS can't believe his eyes. He drops a smoke bomb and disappears in a cloud of purple smoke. However, the smoke clears and MALUS is still standing there. He takes a sheepish look around before zipping out of shot.

BENEVOL is awarded a trophy for winning as the crowd let out an almighty cheer.

EXT. BRIDGE – DAY

MALUS and REGINA are leaving Imbur. They pass BARDUS at the bridge.

      BARDUS
  So who won the big riddling contest?

MALUS and REGINA ignore BARDUS and continue on their way.
